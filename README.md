# AgentCorp — a technology services company run by Google ADK agents

Learning project for Google's Agent Development Kit. Each department of a services company
becomes an agent. **Current stage: Product Manager & Developer multi-agent collaboration.**

## Agents

### 1. The PM Agent (`pm_agent`)
Talks to a client (you, in `adk web`) about any kind of engagement — new build, migration,
integration, data/AI, consulting, support — and turns it into a structured, versioned
requirements spec, published as a Markdown PRD (`prd_v1.md`).

### 2. The Dev Agent (`dev_agent`)
Collaborates as an engineering sub-agent. Inspects the shared session state `state["spec"]`
to formulate technology stack recommendations, design modular system architecture, and plan
the project file structure scaffold, publishing `architecture_v1.md`.

```

```

## Run it

```powershell
cd "agent builder"
.venv\Scripts\activate               # created already; otherwise: python -m venv .venv; pip install -r requirements.txt
copy pm_agent\.env.example pm_agent\.env   # then put your AI Studio key in it
adk web                              # open http://localhost:8000, pick pm_agent
```

Run `adk web` from **this folder** (the parent of `pm_agent/`), not from inside `pm_agent`.

In the dev UI, watch:
- **Events** — every model call and tool call, in order
- **State** — the `spec` key growing as the agent works
- **Artifacts** — `prd_v1.md`, `prd_v2.md`, … each time it publishes

Sessions persist in `.adk/` across restarts (ADK's default local storage).

## Test

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q
```

## Things to try as the client

- A vague, non-technical brief: *"I run 3 dental clinics and the phones never stop ringing."*
- A technical one: *"Move our on-prem Postgres + Java monolith to GCP, max 1 hour downtime."*
- Answer "you decide" to a question and see it become a labelled assumption.
- Ask it for a price or a tech stack — it should decline and redirect.
- After it publishes, change your mind ("drop the mobile app") and see v2 + change log.
- Contradict yourself ("no cloud" … later "must auto-scale") and see whether it notices.
